# CSCI 6212 Fast Response K-Server Placement
## Notes:
- [kserver.py](https://github.com/RajatRayaraddi24/CSCI-6212_Fast_Response_K-Server_Placement/blob/main/kserver.py) generates an output of the minimum total traffic cost, optimal server locations, and the time taken (in nanoseconds) for the algorithm to run for different values of n (number of clients) and k (number of servers) . Also generates a plot for Times v/s n for varying values of k.
- To output a visualization of the optimal server placements amongst the clients: Comment Lines 51-53 and 75-89, Uncomment Lines 45-49 and 66-73. You can change the number of clients (n) and servers (k) in Lines 45 and 46 respectively. You will have to adjust the size of x, y, z in lines 47, 48 and 49 respectively to match the size of n and k. The y-axis is kept constant since the clients are located along a linear network.
- [plot.py](https://github.com/RajatRayaraddi24/CSCI-6212_Fast_Response_K-Server_Placement/blob/main/plot.py) generates a plot for Experimental and Theoretical Times v/s n, the experimental times are taken from one of the runs of [kserver.py](https://github.com/RajatRayaraddi24/CSCI-6212_Fast_Response_K-Server_Placement/blob/main/kserver.py). The data for this plot is also available in [Data.pdf](https://github.com/RajatRayaraddi24/CSCI-6212_Fast_Response_K-Server_Placement/blob/main/Data.pdf).
